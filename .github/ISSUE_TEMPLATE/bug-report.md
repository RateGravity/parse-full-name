## Describe the issue:
Provide a brief explanation of what your're seeing. You should use this as an opportunity to provide any context that is required
to understand the test cases below.

## Provide failing test cases
Each test case should provide the inputs being passed to parse full name, the expected outputs, the actual outputs or errors
For instance:
```js
const result = parseFullName('This Name Is A Tests');
// expected result.first to be 'This'
// actual result.first is 'This Name'
```
